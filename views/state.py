"""
Application state management and user action handling.

This module provides centralized coordination between the UI and application state,
managing the flow of user interactions and ensuring consistent state updates.

Key Components:

State Initialization:
- initialize_session_state(): Sets up the unified StateManager for the session
- Integrates with Streamlit's session_state for persistence across interactions
- Ensures all required state keys are properly initialized

Action Processing:
- handle_app_actions(): Processes user-triggered actions from UI components
- Coordinates between UI events and business logic services
- Provides error handling and user feedback for all operations

Supported Actions:
- Report Generation: Creates and prepares PNG analysis reports for download
- Cache Management: Rebuilds data caches when source files change
- State Resets: Clears user selections and computed results
- Data Refreshes: Triggers reload of external data sources

Integration Points:
This module serves as the main coordination point between:
- UI components (sidebar, main_content, forms)
- Business services (app_operations, calculations, visualization)
- State management (StateManager, Streamlit session_state)
- Error handling (ui_utils messaging functions)

The design ensures that complex user workflows are handled consistently
while maintaining clean separation between UI presentation and business logic.

    Initialize and return the unified application state manager.
    
    Creates or retrieves the StateManager instance that provides centralized
    access to all application state using Streamlit's session_state as the
    underlying storage mechanism.
    
    The StateManager handles:
    - Default value initialization for all state keys
    - Type-safe access to state variables
    - Integration with Streamlit widgets
    - State persistence across page interactions

    Process and execute actions triggered by user interface interactions.
    
    This function serves as the central dispatcher for user actions, coordinating
    between UI events and the appropriate business logic services. It provides

    Args:
        actions: Dictionary of action types and parameters from UI components
                Keys represent action types, values contain action parameters
        state_manager: Unified state manager for accessing and updating application state
        data: Loaded application data including filters, QE, illuminants, etc.
    
    Supported Actions:
        'generate_report': Create PNG analysis report
            - Parameter: selected_camera (str) - name of camera for QE analysis
            - Triggers comprehensive report generation workflow
            - Updates state with export metadata for download functionality
            
        'rebuild_cache': Clear and rebuild data caches
            - Parameter: boolean flag indicating rebuild request
            - Clears all cached data files and triggers application reload
            - Useful when source data files have been updated externally
    
    Error Handling:
        - All operations wrapped in try_operation for consistent error recovery
        - User-friendly error messages displayed via UI messaging system
        - Failed operations don't crash the application or corrupt state
        - Success messages provide clear feedback on completed operations
        
    State Management:
        - Updates state_manager with operation results
        - Triggers Streamlit rerun when state changes require UI refresh
        - Maintains operation history for user reference
